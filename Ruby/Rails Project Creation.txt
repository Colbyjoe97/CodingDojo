First follow the Ruby_Setup file

cd into folder project will be stored in

If using SQLite DB
rails new <proj name> -T

if using postgresql DB 
rails new <proj name> --database=postgresql --skip-test-unit

copy gem file from another proj and paste it in new one

bundle install
rails g rails_footnotes:install
rails g rspec:install

copy everything from SimpleRailsHelper
paste in spec > spec_helper.rb, delete everything else

Creating a model example:
inside project folder -> no commas needed..
rails g model User first_name:string email:string age:integer

User with encrypted password:
rails g model User <any other params like name> password:digest

Model with a relationship:
rails g model <modelName> <first_name, last_name, etc> <model to make
relationship with>:references (mode to make relationship is LOWERcase)

Creating a controller:
rails g controller <name> <any functions you want premade> --no-controller-specs --no-view-specs
ex: 
rails g controller Users index --no-controller-specs --no-view-specs

Migrate:
rake db:migrate

ADDING COLUMN TO EXISTING MODEL:
rails generate migration add_<what to add>_to_<model to add to> 
<what_to_add>:<type> (<-- goes on the same line)

REMOVING COLUMN FROM EXISTING MODEL:
rails generate migration RemoveFieldNameFromTableName field_name:datatype

rake db:migrate

Catch-All Route:
match "*path", to: "application#custom_action", via: :all

To enter rails console:
rails c OR rails console
Hirb.enable

To Delete a model:
rails destroy model <model_name>

To reload console (after migrations):
reload!

To start server:
rails server -b 0.0.0.0
